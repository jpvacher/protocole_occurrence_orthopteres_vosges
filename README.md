# protocole_occurrence_orthopteres_vosges

In this repo, you will find a script to build a protocol for spatial and temporal monitoring of grasshoppers of the Vosges Mountains.
This is an extension from a study based on opportunistic data collections [see the article here](https://www.museumcolmar.org/bulletin/evolution-temporelle-repartition-orthopteres-massif-vosgien-possibles-effets-changements) where we showed that there is a trend of range shift in some Orthopteran species in the Vosges during the last 20 years.
Unfortunately, no data collected through a standardized protocol was available to perform proper analyses of species trend.
Therefore, we decided to come up with a protocol and provide a way to easily build the sampling design using R.
Hopefully this will be usefull for future research on Orthoptera communities in the Vosges mountains.
